Practice exam 1

1. We learned that a Learning Agent can be seen as being composed of
   four interacting components (PEAS). Name the four components and
   briefly describe what each does.

2. For each of the following three task environments, give the six
   attributes (observability, determinism, etc) with a brief
   justification for each. (a) Poker, (b) route finding, (c)
   chess.

3. Given the [[https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~edo/Classes/CS470-570_WWW/Assignments/Prog2-RoadwarriorSearch/Grading/small_tester.html][simple test map]] from program 2, assume we start
   at node F and want to get to node K. Give the order of the first 10
   nodes expanded by (a) breadth first search, (b) depth first search,
   and (c) iterative deepening search. Break ties alphabetically.

4. Genetic algorithms attempt to apply a biological metaphor to the search process.
   (a) Describe the general concept and process of how genetic algorithms work.  Focus on how successor states are generated.  
   (b) What was presented as a particular advantage of genetic algorithms, in comparison to the other local search techniques we looked at?
   (c) What is a weakness of the genetic algorithms approach?
