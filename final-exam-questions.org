  - pay particular attention to the path finding search problems as in
    program 2. Given a graph and start/end nodes, how do the search
    algos (depth first, breadth first, A*) work? What nodes are
    searched, in what order? What path is returned? Is it guaranteed
    to be optimal? What does it mean to have a heuristic that is
    admissible? Consistent?
- Supervised Learning, general
  - a supervised learning algorithm will input a labeled
    training data set, and output what?
  - what are three advantages of supervised machine
    learning, relative to classical programming techniques?
  - Machine learning data sets are usually stored in CSV data files,
    where rows are ___ and columns are ___ and ___ ?
- Overfitting
  - when splitting data into train/test sets, what is the purpose of the train set?
  - when splitting data into train/test sets, what is the purpose of the test set?
  - when splitting a train set into subtrain/validation
    sets, what is the purpose of the subtrain set?
  - when splitting a train set into subtrain/validation
    sets, what is the purpose of the validation set?
  - The goal of supervised machine learning is to get a function that
    yields highly accurate predictions with respect to what data?
  - How can you tell if machine learning model predictions are
    overfitting?
- Cross-validation
  - What is the difference between inner and outer cross-validation?
    What are the input/output sets for each?
  - In 4-fold cross-validation, we randomly assign each observation a fold ID
    in what range of values?
  - In 4-fold cross-validation for subtrain/validation splits, if the
    validation fold ID is 3, then what observations are used as the
    subtrain set?
  - When using 4-fold cross-validation for model evaluation, the test
    set is used for what?
  - To determine if classification models have learned any non-trivial
    patterns in the data, they should be compared with a baseline
    which ignores all inputs/features and always predicts what value?
- Neural networks in torch
  - When using the torch module in python to learn a neural network,
    what data set (all/train/test/subtrain/validation) should you use
    when you compute gradients with the backward method? Why that one
    and not the others?
  - When using torch to learn a neural network, do LARGE or SMALL
    values of the number of steps/iterations/epochs result in
    overfitting? Why?
  - When using torch to learn a neural network, do LARGE or SMALL
    values of the number of hidden units/layers result in overfitting?
    Why?

- Adversarial search
  - Given a tree with known terminal/leaf node utility values, compute
    the value of each parent node. What is the best action to take as
    in the minimax algorithm?
  - Assuming the leaf nodes are visited from left to right on the tree
    diagram, which nodes would be pruned by the alpha-beta algorithm?
  - What would be a node order which results in the most/least pruning
    using the alpha-beta algorithm? Which leaf nodes would be pruned
    in those cases?
