Please make sure that your report contains the commands and output as
shown in [[https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~edo/Classes/CS470-570_WWW/Assignments/Prog1-Boggle/Phase1output.txt][this example output file]]. For each test command
- There should be a >>> prompt followed by the test command,
- followed by the output of that command (from print statements and/or
  the return value),
- followed by a newline (to provide visual separation between each
  command). If you do sys.ps1='\n>>>' then that will print a newline
  before every command prompt.

One way to do this is by simply running "python" which starts the
interactive REPL, and then paste your code in. A more automated way to
do this (less tedious copy-pasting) is by running your python script
through [[file:interpreter.py]].

It is recommended to separate your functions into two files, e.g.,
- [[file:project0_funs.py]] which defines the functions you need for your
  project.
- [[file:project0_tests.py]] which imports those functions and then runs
  the tests.
Then you can run the tests file through [[file:interpreter.py]] to get the
required output, e.g.,

#+begin_src shell-script
$ python interpreter.py project0_tests.py

>>> from project0_funs import *

>>> add(1, 2)
3

>>> add(3, 4)
7

#+end_src

** Exercises

[[https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/][AIMA Exercises]]


** Software

*** pytorch 

[[http://bartek-blog.github.io/python/pytorch/conda/2018/11/12/install-pytorch-with-conda.html][Tutorial explaining pytorch installation under anaconda]]. 

The command I used to install was:

#+begin_src shell-script
conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch
#+end_src

After that you should be able to do =import torch= in python.
